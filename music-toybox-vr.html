              My goal when making this game has been to introduce people to cool
              musical instruments and teach them how to play songs on them.

              As someone with no musical background, the ability to turn
              ‘random’ pitches played at a specific tempo into a beautiful
              melody feels like sorcery to me, and discovering it by playing the
              written notes feels like uncovering a hidden treasure.

              interesting and figure out how they work with minimal
              hand-holding.

            <span>
              Have the instruments play as close to their real-life counterparts
              as possible, so they can make it easier to learn their real

            <br class="music-toybox-vr-text026" />
            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text027">
              I was playing around with different VR prototypes, wanting to
              create a game that could only work with and made full use of VR’s
              unique input possibilities. Around the same time, I was debating
              buying a bass guitar, but decided not to because I didn’t know if
              I’d enjoy playing it or get bored shortly after.
            </span>
            <br class="music-toybox-vr-text028" />
            <br class="music-toybox-vr-text029" />
            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text030">
              However, that led me to think about how (and if) an actual guitar
              could be made in a VR game. I wanted to recreate playing a
              physical guitar, where you would need to actually strum and fret
              each string to play the song, rather than a simplified,
              arcade-style approach such as Guitar Hero.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              I made a very crude M.V.P. the next day where you would ‘fret’ by
              holding the trigger button to press on all the strings at once and
              ‘pluck’ strings by pressing the face buttons.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Despite its simplicity, practising 'Seven Nation Army' on it got
              me immediately hooked.&nbsp;
            </span>
            <span>
              As I kept developing the game, I would debug something and end up
              spending another 20 minutes just practising the song to play it
              better.

              The game didn't start with a clear direction of what I wanted the
              final product to be. Instead, I started from the prototype and I
              analysed what made it feel so fun to play and expand on those
              features.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              This was a challenge at times, as it often meant building and then
              throwing away many concepts that didn't add enough to the core
              experience.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              At first the game was meant to be a rhythm game, but this felt at
              odds with the concept of playing real instruments&nbsp;since they
              would've needed to be simplified to make the VR inputs precise
              enough.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Because of this, the design shifted from the typical gameplay
              challenge of hitting all the right notes at the right time to a
              more relaxed "play at your own pace and learn how the instruments
              work" experience.

            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text051">Designing Instruments:</span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Following from the design pillars of the game, my priorities when
              making the instruments have always been:
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text056">#1</span>
            <span>recreate the playing experience of the real instrument.</span>
            <br />
            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text059">#2</span>
            <span>make them simple and intuitive to play.</span>
            <br />
            <span class="music-toybox-vr-text062">#3</span>
            <span>allow the player to play the vast majority of songs.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Having the instruments resemble their real-life versions as much
              as possible is vital to make sure the players are actually getting
              a real feel for how playing those instruments is like. If the
              instrument is too far removed from the real thing, then learning
              to play them in game is more or less pointless.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            <span>
              Unfortunately, hardware limitations make a 1:1 copy impossible to
              achieve, so some adjustments need to be made. For instance, when
              playing the violin, the musician places their fingers at very
              specific positions on the fretboard, however, finger tracking
              technology is currently unable to track these movements reliably,
              so instead a radial menu is used to allow fast adjustments
              instead.

              When moving from the MVP, the first instrument I tried to
              implement was the violin. I wanted to choose the most complex
              instrument I could to see what the limits of what can be done in
              the game are, so if I had to pivot from the design direction, I
              could do so as early as possible.

              Similarly, I thought making a guitar would also be impossible, as
              it would need to fret and strum multiple strings as the same time,
              which would not be possible to do with a standard VR controller.

            <span>
              Even a controller like the one on the Valve Index, which can
              detect individual finger placement couldn't also track their
              positions, so you still could not fret different strings at
              different positions.

            <span>
              * still not ideal since it doesn't feel like playing on a real
              guitar and very complex for a first time player

            <br />
            <span>
